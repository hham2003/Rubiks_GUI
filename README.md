# Rubik's Cube Model and Graphical Interface
## Project Description
### _rubix_cube.py_:
This file contains a coded model of a standard 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Each face of the cube is represented by 6 lists (1 for each face) of 9 integers each representing one colored square on that face. Each integer corresponds to a color as follows:<br />
0: white
1: green
2: red
3: blue
4: orange
5: yellow<br />

The cube model can be scrambled by using the scramble() method and passing in a list of singular moves in standard Rubik's Cube notation.
